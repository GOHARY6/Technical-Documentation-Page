      <p class="main-paragraph">JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its
        environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
      <p class="main-paragraph">JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety
        of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
      <ul class="inner-list" id="inner-list">
        <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user
          events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
        <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information
          from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="JavaScript_and_Java" class="main-section">
      <header class="header">JavaScript and Java</header>
      <p class="main-paragraph">JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most
        Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
      <p class="main-paragraph">In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a
        prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without
        any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
      <p class="main-paragraph">JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you
        do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>

    </section>
    <section id="Variables" class="main-section">
      <header class="header">Variables</header>
      <p class="main-paragraph">You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
      <p class="main-paragraph">A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z"
        (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
      <p class="main-paragraph">You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="Data_types" class="main-section">
      <header class="header">Data types</header>
      <p class="main-paragraph">The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:
      <ul class="inner-list" id="inner-list">
        <li>Six data types that are primitives:
          <ul class="2nd-inner-list" id="2nd-inner-list">
            <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
            <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
            <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
            <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
            <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
            <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>and Object</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="Function_declarations" class="main-section">
      <header class="header">Function declarations</header>
      <p class="main-paragraph">A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
      <ul>
        <li>The name of the function.</li>
        <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
        <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p class="main-paragraph">For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:</p>
      <div> <code class="code">function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
        <code class="code">function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
        <code class="code">function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
        <code class="code">function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
        <code class="code">function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
      </div>
